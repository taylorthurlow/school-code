This program first prompts the user for an integer value between 1 and 100, inclusive. This is the number of integers which the user will be prompted for. After entering this value, the program will prompt, individually, for each integer. After each entry, the integer is stored on the stack in an array. With each insertion, the array is sorted using a bubble sort. This ensures that the integers are always stored in-order while on the stack. Once the number of originally chosen integers has been entered, the integers will be printed, in order, back to the console. It will then print the highest and lowest values in the array.

Following this, the program prompts the user for an integer to search for. Once provided, the program will search the array of integers and display a message explaining whether or not the integer provided was found in the array. 

Please see case{1,2,3,4}.txt for register and console data.
