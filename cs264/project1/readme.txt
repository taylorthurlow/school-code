This program comes in three versions. The basic idea is that the program will prompt for 20 integer values in the console, store them in memory, and then display them in the console. Each version displays the integers in a different way. In addition, the 3rd version also prompts the user to enter an integer value which represents how many integers will be printed per line.

Execution is as simple as entering values as the program requests them until it stops asking. If the 3rd version is being run, then it will ask for a number of entries to print per line. The 1st version will print the array of integers in the order they were given, each on their own line. The 2nd version will print the array of integers in order, all on the same line. The 3rd will print in reverse order, with line breaks as explained previously.
