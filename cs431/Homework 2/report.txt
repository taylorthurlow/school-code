My custom algorithm is a slightly modified version of Elevator. Whenever you get below 5 requests queued, and add 10 new requests, after adding the new requests, set the elevator direction to the direction which contains the MOST amount of delay. The algorithm sums the total amount of delay for all requests above the current head position, and the same for all requests below the head position. It then continues moving in the direction which had the most delay. Over 1,000,000 seeks, it ends up being slightly slower than regular Elevator. Despite my efforts, I was not able to find an algorithm that reliably had better results than the other two.
