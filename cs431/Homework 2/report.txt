Because my custom algorithm doesn't always edge out Elevator with 1000 seeks, here's 1,000,000:

My custom algorithm is a slightly modified version of Elevator. Whenever you get below 5 requests queued, and add 10 new requests, after adding the new requests, set the elevator direction to the direction which contains FEWER requests. Over 1 million seeks, this looks to be 0.74% faster. Results often fluctuate between Elevator and my custom algorithm when only using 1000 seeks.
